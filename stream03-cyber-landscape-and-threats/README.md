## High-level Notes
* Insider threat reduction is achieved with personnel training (coaching also)
* Get the end-users to understand measured response
* Focus on business processes.
* Security vs. Usability 
* Must know you attackers. 
* Overlap between legal issues and security ones. 
* Try to give the user secure options, or theyâ€™ll use functional but insecure ones. 
* Know you crown jewels. 
* Top threat is the insider (intentionally or otherwise). 
* Logical separation of technical systems and business processes. 
* Tools being implemented poorly is a massive risk (either from controls not performing as expected, or applications being vulnerable). 
* Defence in depth
* Using gamification to get the message across to end users. 
* Social engineering resistance training.
