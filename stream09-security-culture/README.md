# Stream 9 - Security Culture
Establishing and maintaining a security culture is one of the most important things a business can do.
But how do we do this and what methods can we use? What methods work? What don’t?

*Notes from the interactive session held at Scot Secure 2019 on 28 March 2019*

## We all have the same challenges:
When security is contacted (on a project), it’s only to pay lip-service with no real intention of implementing any recommendations.

Security is seen as a blocker to projects / progress.

There is often a conflict in security culture between physical security and cyber security, where one or the other is seen as more important or the ‘only’ type of security that really counts.

Security is not part of corporate culture.

For security to success there has to be Board level buy in.

Security advice / input is not risk based or pragmatic (i.e. tailored to specific circumstances / projects) this contributes to security being seen as a blocker.

Regulatory requirements often work against the security team who is trying to implement a positive culture, requiring training and punishment of those who make mistakes after they have been trained.

Legal or HR type wording in training is counter-productive and contributes to a negative view of the security team.

Casual / contract staff are often treated differently to permanent staff. They often have very limited time

The culture within security is often divergent.

Security culture MUST be balanced with business requirements.

Many problems are due to a breakdown in vertical communication
-	Security must have a seat at the Board
-	There is often an overload of information at Board level; security is just one of the many things on the agenda

## Solutions:
### Training & awareness:
Training should be short/fast/fun.

It must be easier to change training to respond to current threats, or even to change direction entirely.

Training should be Interactive rather than ‘death by PowerPoint’.

Training should be TAILORED to specific teams / departments / individuals.

When discussing security in team meetings – use examples specific to that team.

Training works well when you can pivot it to their personal lives.

Use real life examples.

Enable users to admit errors / mistakes
-	Have a streamlined easy to use reporting mechanism


### General security work:
Security Champions can be a success story, but has its own challenges to set up.

Reduce complexity (Much of security is common sense… We all need to remember that it can be simple.)

Streamline the approach to business.

Business teams need to feed into security culture.

You need buy in from the CISO / Board.

Impact should drive action.

We must remember that Project Managers are customers of security.

Reward good behaviour rather than punishing bad
-	Always thank people for reporting
-	Tell managers when someone has done something good (like reporting an incident)

**COMMUNICATION** is a key skill needed for everyone working in security


### Suggestion for further co-operation:
Industry to work with Academia (and government) to equip graduates with the right skills
-	More apprentice / graduate opportunities are needed

NCSC website has good information on approaching the board

### Reporting:
**Challenge:**	business ask for reports from infosec, but cannot exactly define what information they need or what they want to do with the information / report. How do we get the business to actively engage to shape requirements / baseline information?
**Solution:**	one solution is to stop providing reports, this eliminates reports that are not actively used (and leads to less workload for infosec!)

**Challenge:**	It is difficult to ‘sell’ security, as it is almost impossible to show a return on investment or tangible benefit for money spent.
**Solution:**	Security should be seen as an insurance policy – you need to spend the money to prevent catastrophe from impacting your business.

### Risk Management:
Who does the risk analysis in your organisation?

Answers were usually a mix of business and technical teams.

We must enable ownership of risk.

In order to get things fixed (and have the necessary buy in) you have to talk to the right people (risk owner).

We must remember that:
-	Risk will always remain
-	Security will always fail at some time

Advice for security folk: do not take it personally. Business / projects make decisions based on their objectives, it really is not meant as a personal affront to you.
